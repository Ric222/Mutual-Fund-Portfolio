# Mutual Fund Portfolio Tracker ðŸ¤‘


I have built a **Mutual Fund Portfolio Tracker** in **Excel** for keeping track of mutual fund investments. It gives an overview of money we have **invested**, the **current market value**, **profit/loss** we have made and **percentage return**. We can also see individual performance of each mutual fund. 

Returns are the basic benchmarks for investors while going for any investments. These indicate how much the fund has lost or gained during a particular investment duration.

To calculate the returns made on different dates, I have used **XIRR** function which gives the **real return** on our investments. 

XIRR stands for *Extended Internal Rate of Return* is a method used to calculate returns where there are *multiple transactions* happening at different times. It can take care of all the scenarios and help to calculate a consolidated return considering **timings of investment and withdrawals**.

As we purchase a new mutual fund, it will get updated in the sheet.
